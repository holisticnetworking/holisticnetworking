# Thomas Belknap (holisticnetworking) 😎  
**Senior web developer · open source builder · accessibility-first**

I build websites and tools that don’t fall apart in six months.

That usually means: **clean architecture**, **structured data**, **boringly reliable code**, and UX details (especially forms) that don’t make users want to throw laptops into rivers.

## What I do

- **Web platforms & content systems** (data modeling, workflows, integrations)
- **Accessible UI engineering** (semantic HTML, forms, usability-first patterns)
- **API work** (integration-heavy builds, clean contracts, reliable interfaces)
- **Python development** (modernization work, automation, and backend services)
- **Maintainability-first code** (predictable structure, readable changes, stable behavior)

If it’s meant to last, I’m interested.

## Stuff worth clicking

A few repos that represent my “shipping” style:

- **easy-inputs** — Error-resistant form & input templating (good UX is a feature)  
- **restrictionroulette** — Creative constraint generator for composers (rules are fun)  
- **api-platform-test** — Platform experiments (TypeScript, API shapes, and integration patterns)  
- **title-to-terms** — Metadata automation + clean tagging workflows  
- **wp-scholar** — Structured content types (content modeling in practice)

## How I think about software

- Code is communication.
- A feature isn’t done until it’s *maintainable*.
- If the data model isn’t clear, everything downstream gets expensive.
- Accessibility isn’t “extra,” it’s the floor.

## I’ve shipped a lot of work in...

- CMS-heavy environments *(yes, including WordPress)*  
- Higher-ed / publishing-style systems  
- Python-backed tooling and modernization efforts  
- Long-lived platforms where stability matters more than novelty

---

## Ask me about

- Designing maintainable systems that survive real life  
- Forms, templates, and UI patterns that reduce user error  
- Content modeling and metadata workflows  
- Practical modernization: “make it better without breaking everything”  
- Debugging the “this shouldn’t be happening” kind of problems 😅
